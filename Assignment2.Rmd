**Instructions** You may adapt the code in the course materials or any
sources (e.g., the Internet, classmates, friends). In fact, you can
craft solutions for almost all questions from the course materials with
minor modifications. However, you need to write up your own solutions
and acknowledge all sources that you have cited in the Acknowledgement
section.

Failing to acknowledge any non-original efforts will be counted as
plagiarism. This incidence will be reported to the Student Judicial
Affairs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

A consulting firm is investigating the relationship between wages and
some demographic factors. The file `Wage.csv` contains three columns,
which are

-   `wage`, the wage of the subject,
-   `ethnicity`, the ethnicity of the subject,
-   and `occupation`, the occupation of the subject.

```{r,echo=T,results=F,message=F}
Wage=read.csv('Wage.csv');
library(gplots)
library(lme4)
attach(Wage)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Write down a two-way ANOVA model for this data. For consistency,
    choose the letters from $\{Y,\alpha, \beta, \mu, \epsilon\}$ and use
    the factor-effect form.

$$Y_{ijk} = \mu_{\cdot\cdot} + \alpha_i+\beta_j + (\alpha\beta)_{ij}+\epsilon_{ijk}, \ k=1,\ldots, 534, j=1,\ldots, 3, i=1,\ldots, 6,$$
where $\{\epsilon_{ijk}\}$ are i.i.d. $N(0,\sigma^2)$ and \begin{align}
\sum_i \alpha_i & = \sum_j \beta_j=0\\
\sum_{i=1}^6 (\alpha\beta)_{ij} & =\sum_{j=1}^3 (\alpha\beta)_{ij} =0, \ \forall i,j
\end{align}

In this model, $\alpha_i$ represent the effect from the six occupation
conditions, which are management ($i=1$), office ($i=2$), sales ($i=3$),
services ($i=4$), technical ($i=5$), and worker ($i=6$). $\beta_j$
represents the 3 ethnicity factors which are hispanic ($j=1$), cauc
($j=2$), and other ($j=3$) The outcome $Y_{i,j,k}$ represents the $k$th
subject under $i$th condition and $j$th factor. The mean effect
$\mu_{\cdot\cdot}$ represents the mean wage in the population. The
errors $\epsilon_{i,j,k}$ capture any unexplained effects on wages
Values of 534 can be found in the following table.

```{r}
table(Wage$ethnicity, Wage$occupation)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

(2) Obtain the main effects plots and the interaction plot. Summarize
    your findings.

```{r}
#par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plotmeans(wage~ethnicity, data = Wage, main="Main effect, ethnicity")
plotmeans(wage~occupation, data = Wage, main="Main effect, occupation")
```

```{r}
interaction.plot(Wage$occupation, Wage$ethnicity, Wage$wage, main = "Interaction")
```

It seems that there is an interaction between wage and occupation since
I read [here](https://www.statology.org/interaction-plot-r/) that if
they are not parrallel there could be an interaction.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

(3) Fit the ANOVA model described in Part 1. Obtain the ANOVA table and
    state your conclusions. Are the findings here consistent with your
    initial assessments from Part 2?

```{r}
model1 = aov(wage ~ occupation * ethnicity, data = Wage)
summary(model1)
```

No, they are not consistent with my initial assessment because the
p-value of the interaction is rather high so it seems that there is not
an interaction effect.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

(4) Carry out a test to decide if the effect of ethnicity is present on
    the full data set, at the significance level $\alpha=0.01$.

$$
H_0: \beta_{j} = (\alpha\beta)_{ij}=0 \ {\rm v.s.} \ H_1: {\rm not \ all \ } (\alpha\beta)_{ij} \ {\rm are \ zero \ and \ not \ all } \ \beta_{j} \ {\rm are \ zero}
$$ We now need to use the following framework for testing. \* Full
model:
$Y_{ijk} =\mu_{\cdot\cdot} + \alpha_i+\beta_j + (\alpha\beta)_{ij}+\epsilon_{ijk}$
\* Reduced model: $Y_{ijk} =\mu_{\cdot\cdot} + \alpha_i +\epsilon_{ijk}$

```{r}
full_model = lm(wage ~ occupation * ethnicity, data = Wage)
reduced_model = lm(wage~occupation, data = Wage)
anova(full_model, reduced_model)
```

The p-value is significant significant so we fail to reject the null
hypothesis so we conclude that ethnicity is not that important in
affecting wages.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

(5) For this part and the next, assume that the occupations have been
    selected randomly. Write down an appropriate ANOVA model that is
    additive in the factors and explain the terms in the model.

```{r}
#we will use a random effects model, ethnicty not randomly selected
model2 = lmer(wage ~ (1 |occupation) + ethnicity, data = Wage)
summary(model2)
```

The factor-effect form is
$$Y_{ijk}=\mu_{\cdot\cdot} + \tau_i+ \beta_{j} + \epsilon_{ij},$$ where
$\epsilon_{ij}$ are i.i.d. $N(0,\sigma^2)$, $\tau_i$ are i.i.d.
$N(0,\sigma_{\tau}^2)$, and $\epsilon_i$ is independent with $\tau_{i'}$
for any $i, i' \in \{1,\ldots,r\}$. Here $\tau_i = \mu_i - \mu_{\cdot}$
and $\sigma_{\tau}=\sigma_{\mu}$.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

(6) Assuming that the model in Part 5 is appropriate, obtain an estimate
    of the proportion of variability that is due to variability in
    occupation.

```{r}
VarCorr(model2)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

(7) Consider a two-way ANOVA model with fixed effects
    \begin{equation}\label{eqn:anova_two}
    Y_{i,j,k}=\mu + \alpha_i+ \beta_j+\epsilon_{i,j,k}, \  i =1,\ldots, a, j=1,\ldots, b, k=1,\ldots, n
    \end{equation} where $\{ \alpha_i\}$ satisfies that
    $\sum_{i}^a \alpha_i=0$, $\{\beta_j\}$ satisfies that
    $\sum_{j}^b \beta_j=0$, and $\{\epsilon_{i,j,k}\}$ are i.i.d.
    $N(0,\sigma^2)$. Derive the least squares estimator from the above
    equation.\

------------------------------------------------------------------------

(8) Consider the following models \begin{equation}\label{eqn:cellmeans}
    Y_{i,j,k}=\mu_{i,j}+\epsilon_{i,j,k}, \ k=1,\ldots, n, i =1,\ldots, a, j=1,\ldots, b, 
    \end{equation} and \begin{equation}\label{eqn:reg}
    Y_{i,j,k}= \sum_{l=1}^a \sum_{m=1}^b \beta_{l,m} X_{l,m;i,j,k}+\epsilon_{i,j,k}, \ k=1,\ldots, n, i =1,\ldots, a, j=1,\ldots, b,
    \end{equation} where $\{\epsilon_{i,j,k}\}$ are i.i.d.
    $N(0,\sigma^2)$ and $X_{l,m;i,j,k}=1$ when $(l,m)=(i,j)$ and
    $X_{l,m;i,j,k}=0$ otherwise. Express
    $\{\beta_{l,m}: l=1,\ldots, a; m=1,\ldots, b\}$ using
    $\{\mu_{i,j}: i=1,\ldots, a; j=1,\ldots, b\}$.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

(9) With some abuse of notation, we rewrite the regression model from
    Question 8 as \begin{equation}\label{eqn:reg_new}
    Y= X\beta + \epsilon,
    \end{equation} where $Y$ is a $n_T$-dimensional vector, $X$ is an
    $n_T \times p$ matrix, $\beta$ is a $p$-dimensional vector, and
    $\{\epsilon\} \sim {\rm MVN}(0, \sigma^2 {\rm I})$, i.e.,
    multivariate normal with covariance matrix $\sigma^2 {\rm I}$.
    Express the residual sum of squares and explained sum of squares in
    $Y$ and $X$, and then show that these two sum of squares are
    independent.
